Static Data delivery
========
the static data delivery component is a persistent graph store that creates a persistent cache for certain graph queries. It is designed for systems with which only expect a view write requests but a high throughput on read requests.


## getting started
in order to use the static data delivery component you have to create the folder `/usr/share/sdd/` and own it with your user. LevelDB and neo4j data stores will be placed in this folder.
